        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>As a Digital Media Artist, I produce websites, videos, and photos that come together to not only tell a unique story but to also evoke emotions. I want to explore the infinite possibilities that digital media offers through visual means. My work serves to visually express these stories and emotions. Each piece forces viewers to confront themselves with their own ideas, thoughts, and emotions, both negative and positive. I believe that all people go through different yet similar experiences, and my art showcases those experiences and helps people to reflect and grow. I use a combination of music and visuals to encapsulate these stories and help me inspire others to draw their own conclusion. Technology is constantly evolving, and I want to combine these new techniques and methods to challenge the traditional idea of what art is.

Through this program, I want to learn all the inner workings of video production, programming and 3D modeling in the hopes that one day I can create my own XR experiences. I believe that experience is what defines a person. Experiences give someone their identity and personalities. Events that occur and things that people do all play a role in shaping who they are. Thatâ€™s why, through my art, I plan on creating experiences that will allow people to challenge their own thoughts and think critically about what is in front of them. I want to create experiences, not in the way of user experiences like website UX but VR/AR experiences where people can do anything they want in the comfort of their own home. For example, one idea I had was an underwater experience, where the user goes through an underwater journey. Through this journey, they get to explore sea life and interact with certain things. Also, the user would experience what pollution has done to our oceans. The experience would end with the user come up to the surface of the water, followed by a gasp of air, and then boom all white screen. </p>
