    <h3>Another Day, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
    <p> Everyday is just another day. My concept for this video was regardless of all the bad things that have happened, pick yourself up and move forward. I know alot of people espeically college students go through many struggles in their lives from social matters, to family matters to, personaly matters. Everyone has something that is going wrong in their lives. Most of the time, those people end up doing bad things to cope. I wanted to create a video that tells people it is ok that they are going through something because they are not alone. Everyone is going through something and they just need to move past it and look forward. Currently, it may feel bad but tomorrow will be another day. Another 24 hours of living. I wanted to use the same layout as Wong Fu, with a story because I feel it is the best way to convey this idea. Teach a lesson through a story or a PSA rather than a video open to interpretation.  </p>

    <h3>Everyday Sounds, Video Installation, 2019</h3>
    <p> We hear the same sounds everyday, over and over again, but no one ever gives it much thought. From the start of our day with our alarm to the last thing we hear before we go to bed, there are numerous unique sounds. I wanted to take those sounds and turn it into a symphony. I recorded prominant sounds that I hear everyday and mashed it all together to create a symphony of sounds. This project would be displayed in a gallery with three different screens. I want each screen to show whatever was making the current sound. Each screen would be playing simultaneously with each other, playing their own videos.         </p>

    <h3>ASMR, Website, 2019</h3>
    <p>Recently, there has been an internet phenomenon. That phenomemnon is Mukbangs and ASMR videos where people post videos of themselves eating and making sound effects while telling stories. I was always curious as to why people seek entertainment from watching people eat. Therefore for this project, I decided to film myself eating while watching a prominant Food Youtuber name Quang Tran to critique this phenomenon. I proceeded to add all my videos onto a website where I used the colors red and yellow in the design because yellow and red colors are scientifically proven to make people hungry.</p>

      <h3>Mario, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
      <p>For this project, my concept was nostalgia, the advancement of technologies and the haunting of the past. I used Mario as my mechanism to show my concept. I wanted Mario to constantly run on the screen from left to right to show the evolution of Mario throughout the years. I wanted to evoke the emotion of nostalgia and to question why retro is a thing. Despite the advancement in gaming technologies and game concepts, people still play the older Mario games. People probably do this because the older Mario games bring us back to a time where things were much simpler. It brings us back to a time where all we had to worry about was having fun or going to school. It was a escape. The music was created with 8 bit Mario sounds to evoke that nostalgic feeling.</p>
